MR-TIM: MR-based head tissue modelling is open source MATLAB software for head tissue modelling from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images.
It performs automated segmentation of T1-weighted MR images in 12 tissues: brain gray matter (GM), cerebellar GM, brain white matter (WM), cerebellar WM, brainstem, cerebrospinal fluid, spongy bone, compact bone, muscle, fat, eyes and skin.

MR-TIM requires MATLAB 2016b (MathWorks) or later versions and it is intended as a toolbox for SPM12 software package (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12).
To use the software, unzip its folder and copy it in the folder “spm12 > toolbox”.
